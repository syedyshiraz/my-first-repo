*How to Use Your Paperback Book Cover Template*


1. Open the template: Launch the PDF file for the Paperback Book Cover Template in your preferred image editing software.
2. Create a design layer: Add a new layer to serve as your primary design workspace.
3. Design your cover:
    * Use the template PDF as a guide layer (do not move or modify it).
    * Extend artwork to the outer edges of the template to prevent unwanted white borders.
4. Text and image placement:
    * Keep readable text/images strictly within the pink zone.
    * Avoid placing critical content in the white zones.
5. Barcode area:
    * Do not place text or essential images in the blue-marked barcode area.
    * Fill this space with background colors/designs (we’ll add the ISBN barcode automatically).
6. Finalize layers:
    * Disable the guide layer before export (or ensure your design fully covers it if layering isn’t possible).
7. Export and upload:
    * Flatten all layers.
    * Save as a press-quality PDF with a CMYK color profile.
    * Upload the finalized file.
